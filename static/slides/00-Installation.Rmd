# Get to know RStudio
When you first open it, the RStudio interface is divided into four “Panes”:
<center><img src="https://bookdown.org/maddocent/exploratory_data_analysis/_book/images/rstudio_interface.png" height="350px"/></center>

---

1.Top LEFT: the **editor** where you edit scripts and documents

---

2.Top RIGHT: your **environment/history** panes. This is where you can see variables you’ve created and a full history of functions / commands you have run,

---

3.Bottom RIGHT: The bottom right pane by default contains several panes including: **files/plots/packages/help/viewer**. We will explore these various panes together in class.

---

4.Bottom LEFT: the **R console** is where the code is run. You can type code directly into the console OR you can send it to the console by running it from the editor. 

---

The placement of these panes and their content can be customized using the RStudio preferences: 
- (From the RStudio drop down choose: **RStudio -> Preferences -> Pane Layout**). 
- You can also drag the panes using your mouse to move / resize them.)
