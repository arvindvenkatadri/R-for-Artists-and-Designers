This course will give Art and Design students a foundation in the principles and practice of data visualization using R.

The viewpoint of of this course is of using R to **create geometric metaphors**. Diverse domains have their own uniquely structured data. These will be depicted using geometric metaphors to enable better understanding of the underlying circumstances and realities.
