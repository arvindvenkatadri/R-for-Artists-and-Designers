This course will give students a foundation in the principles and practice of data visualization, and machine learning, particularly as applied to art and design. 

We will have weekly lectures and code walkthroughs, and the viewpoint of using R as a way of creating metaphors for a variety of circumstances and realities in diverse domains will be stressed. Data will be drawn from these domains and understood via geometric metaphors created in R.
