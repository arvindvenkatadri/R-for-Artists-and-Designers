This course will give Art and Design students a foundation in the principles and practice of data visualization, and machine learning,using R.

We will have weekly lectures and code walkthroughs, and the viewpoint of using R as a way of creating geometric metaphors for a variety of circumstances and realities in diverse domains will be stressed. Data will be drawn from these domains and understood via the geometric metaphors created in R.
