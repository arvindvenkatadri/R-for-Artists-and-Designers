## Introduction

> 'Silence, every one of you!' cried the Tiger-lily, waving itself
> passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. 'They
> know I can't get at them!' it panted, bending its quivering head
> towards Alice, 'or they wouldn't dare to do it!'
>
> 'Never mind!' Alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the
> daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, 'If you don't
> hold your tongues, I'll pick you!'
>
> -   Through the Looking Glass. Chapter 2. Lewis Carroll

Often the data we want is not available readily in a form we can import
into R. It may be available as part of a table on a webpage, or even on
several webpages that require human interaction to navigate, view, and
copy. These operations can be automated to a great extent ( based on the
complexity of the website) and the resulting data neatly made available
as a tibble in a R session.

We will learn about the `rvest` package to scrape data from static
pages, and then the `RSelenium` package to obtain data from interactive
websites.


## Setting up the R packages

```{r}
#| label: setup
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(RSelenium)

```
