## Introduction

We can use R to create complicated *diagrams* too ! Flow charts, Gantt charts, Org charts...all with R. We will use packages such as `nomnoml` and `DiagrammeR`, also try the language D2 <https://d2lang.com> to achieve these ends. There is also an R package called `bpmnR` that allows to create Business Process Model Diagrams <https://www.bpmn.org>

```{r setup, include = TRUE}

library(tidyverse)
library(DiagrammeR)
library(nomnoml)
library(bpmnR)

```
